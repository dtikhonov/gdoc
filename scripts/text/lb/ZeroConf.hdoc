ID: ZConf_Help
NAME: ZeroConfig Settings

DESCR: ZeroConfig is a feature that allows authorized client servers to send their configuration 
(domains, ip addresses, ports, etc.) to LiteSpeed Web ADC. This feature provides an alternative way to set up load 
balancing dynamically rather than working with the webadmin interface. The ZeroConfig API describes the messages 
accepted by the ZeroConfig feature. This section provides the interface to enable and configure the ZeroConfig feature.
